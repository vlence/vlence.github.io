Today I watched a [YouTube video of a man talking about his
experience as a developer][1]. He is essentially proposing
how you can go from being "just" a developer, a cog in
the machine, to being a leader.

I've actually watched quite a few videos like this and
read posts. LinkedIn is full of them. The sentiment is
almost always along the lines of, "If you're not doing
this and in this very specific way, you're losing out." A
sort of FOMO.

Listening to the man I was led to the question: What did
he mean exactly by being a leader? From the video it
seemed like he means someone who makes the decisions and
steers the ship. He is encouraging his viewers to stop
being "just" a deverloper.

There is some sound advice here I think:
- Document your progress
- Think in terms of what outcomes your work will produce
for your client/employer
- Is there really work to be done here or is it just
fluff?

I can personally relate with the challenge of being
myopic: just getting lost in the technical details and
overlooking or not even being aware of the big picture. In
my case it's just a knee-jerk reaction: see problem, solve
problem.

History and experience teaches you time and time again
that it's better not to immediately jump into problem
solving mode and rather think up a number of solutions and
the cons of the solutions.

Coming back to the question of leading, who is a leader?
What makes a leader? Someone who leads of course. In the
basest terms leading is simply showing the direction,
telling others where to go and what to do.

But what qualifies you to be a leader? Shouldn't it be
that you actually know the way? When walking through a
trek or forest wouldn't you want your leader to know the
way and what to watch out for, where the camp sites are,
what to do when you get stuck or lost?

Knowing the way requires you to have gone through it
before, possibly being led by someone else. I find it
interesting to note that leading requires someone to be
led; it's not something you do alone. You cannot do it
alone. It's a partnership of sorts. Because otherwise who
are you showing the way to?

But going back to the video and its ilk now. Again, a lot
of them seem to be proposing some kind of dichotomy that
if you're not a leader or something else you're falling
behind and losing out. But is that true? If everyone's
a leader who's doing the work? If everyone's working who's
taking the responsibility of making the right decisions?

I think everyone in their capacity should strive to be a
leader in their role. Leader has become a very fancy word
though and people seem to get lost in its glamour but the
picture it paints is one of servitude. It's not so much
about telling others what to do but to have borne the pain
of going through it yourself just so that you can lessen
the pain of the next one going through it. This ultimately
requires you to bear with them.

To lead well you must know the way well. In simple terms
it just means being really good at what you do. So good
that you can even tell when your expertise is unnecessary.
This takes time and I don't think it does anyone any
favors to get anxious about where they are in their
careers, relative to others. Getting that good at anything
takes a lot of time.

So what is leading then? I think it's being really good at
something, enough to be able to tell others how to go
about it. Anyone can be a leader in their field and role.
Everyone needs a leader as well.
