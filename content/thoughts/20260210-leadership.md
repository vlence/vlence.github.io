title: "What is leadership?"

Today I watched a [YouTube video of a man talking about his
experience as a developer][1]. He is essentially proposing
how you can go from being "just" a developer, a cog in
the machine, to being a leader.

I've actually watched quite a few videos like this and
read posts. LinkedIn is full of them. The sentiment is
almost always along the lines of, "If you're not doing
this and in this very specific way, you're losing out." A
sort of FOMO.

Listening to the man I was led to the question: What did
he mean exactly by being a leader? From the video it
seemed like he means someone who makes the decisions and
steers the ship. He is encouraging his viewers to stop
being "just" a deverloper.

There is some sound advice here I think:
- Document your progress
- Think in terms of what outcomes your work will produce
for your client/employer
- Is there really work to be done here or is it just
fluff?

I can personally relate with the challenge of being
myopic: just getting lost in the technical details and
overlooking or not even being aware of the big picture. In
my case it's just a knee-jerk reaction: see problem, solve
problem.

History and experience teaches you time and time again
that it's better not to immediately jump into problem
solving mode and rather think up a number of solutions and
the cons of the solutions.

Coming back to the question of leading, who is a leader?
What makes a leader? Someone who leads of course. In the
basest terms leading is simply showing the direction,
telling others where to go and what to do.

But what qualifies you to be a leader? Shouldn't it be
that you actually know the way? When walking through a
trek or forest wouldn't you want your leader to know the
way and what to watch out for, where the camp sites are,
what to do when you get stuck or lost?

Knowing the way requires you to have gone through it
before, possibly being led by someone else. I find it
interesting to note that leading requires someone to be
led; it's not something you do alone. You cannot do it
alone. It's a partnership of sorts. Because otherwise who
are you showing the way to?

But going back to the video and its ilk now. Again, a lot
of them seem to be proposing some kind of dichotomy that
if you're not a leader or something else you're falling
behind and losing out. But is that true? If everyone's
a leader who's doing the work? If everyone's working who's
taking the responsibility of making the right decisions?

It seems obvious to me that you need both kinds of people:
the doers and the leaders. One isn't better than the other
and one cannot do without the other. However I do think,
or at least I am starting to, that we should naturally
progress towards being a leader at whatever we do.

I think we should naturally progress towards being a
leader because we naturally get better at doing things,
if we want to. I think we should want to get better at
whatever we do. It is important to do things well and
make sure it is done well. Once you're good at something
you're at a position to show others how to do that thing
well; you can lead them.

Some people can lead a nation, some can lead just one
other person. I don't think it matters too much how many
people you can lead and/or are leading; quality over
quantity.

It takes a lot of time and effort to get good at
something. I don't think people should worry too much
about how others are progressing in their own careers;
it's just unnecessary anxiety and doesn't really help. We
can learn from them, sure, but there's really no point
comparing and feeling bad about ourselves. It seems a lot
more prudent to simply get better at what I do.
