I believe there is a God. More specifically I believe that the God of
the Bible is real and true.

One of the themes you keep coming across in the Bible is that of trust.
Trust in God, trust in man, trust in money, etc. Trust.

What is trust? Trust is the outcome of believing something is true. If
you trust that the money I gave you is real then you will use that money
and not report me to the police. If you trust the GPS when it says, "Take
a right and you will reach your destination" you will take a right turn.

Something I've learned about myself and which I believe is true for
everyone is that we can't know everything. I don't know everything about
myself, my family, my friends, the food I eat, the air I breathe, the
language I speak, the things I do, the things I know, the things I don't
know, etc.

In such a situation, where I don't know everything, how then can I
operate? Not knowing can be uncomfortable. Realising that you don't know
is sobering. Yet we move on, yet we live our lives, daily, not knowing
it all.

Not knowing, uncertainties, conjure up many images of what could be,
what might be possible, what might happen. Some are happy thoughts, while
others scary.

We trust that the toaster will toast the bread today the same way it
toasted the bread yesterday. We trust that the road we took to work will
take us to work again. We trust that when we come back home we will see
our family again. We trust that we will be able to solve a problem if we
think about it and look for a solution.

Life is a lot of trusting.

Could we trust if the toaster behaved differently everyday? Could we
trust if the toaster spontaneously could stop existing and exit our
thoughts and imaginations? Could we trust if the road took you to a new
place every time you used it?

Trust seems to be built upon familiarity and an unchanging-ness. It seems
to me that it is rather difficult to trust in something or someone if it
is fluid.

And so, I go back to my initial statement. I believe in the God of the
Bible. The Bible describes God in many ways and one such description
is "Rock". The idea is of a rock in the middle of a raging ocean, in a
thunderstorm, that doesn't budge and is unbothered. It stands and stays
the same through heat and cold, night and day, season after season, year
after year. The same yesterday, today, forever.

If God is real and I cannot trust Him then that's a scary proposition.
The Bible says that God doesn't change. If that's true then that's great
news. For instance it means if He says I can be forgiven of my sins then
I can be rest assured that my sins can definitely be forgiven and rest
easy.

If we can't know everything and God made us that way, from my discussion
above it would suggest that God intended for us to live our lives based
on trust. I believe that, chiefly, God designed us so that we would live
our lives trusting in Him. He gave us the faculties of our mind, our
body, etc. but I believe He intends for us to use them while trusting in
Him.

To trust Him would simply mean to take Him at His word and to wait on
Him. Why should I love God? Because He said so. Why should I love my
neighbour? Because He said so.

Suddenly life is not that complicated anymore; I don't need to know or
understand everything.

I simply need to know and find out what He wants me to do.
