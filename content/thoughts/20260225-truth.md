> My truth.

> Your truth.

These phrases don't make sense to me. How is truth supposed to be
subjective and/or personal?

The very nature of truth is that it is absolute and stands on its
own. If something is true it will always be true, even if nobody
acknowledges the truth's existence.

Maybe people use such phrases to mean something else, I don't know.
It just grinds my gears a little when I hear it; so contradictory.
