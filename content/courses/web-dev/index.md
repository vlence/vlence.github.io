In this course you will learn to build websites and web
applications. I do not expect you to know any programming.
All that is expected of you is the ability to read English,
think for yourself, and follow instructions when provided.

Here's a general outline of the course:
1. Introduction to web development
    1. History
    2. Understand your browser
    3. Foundational web technologies: HTML, CSS & JavaScript
2. Understanding HTML
3. What exact is cascading in Cascading Style Sheets?
4. How JavaScript came to be
5. Bringing it all together

A good place to start when learning something is to learn about its
history: how it came about and why. It's often quite boring in the
beginning but having this knowledge helps us have the right mindset once
we begin to explore the problems that web technologies aim to solve.

Our first lesson is [a brief history of the web](01-history/).
