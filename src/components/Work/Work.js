          Currently I work in InTown Solutions as a Node.js developer. I do quite a few things.
        </p>
        <p>
          More often than not I'm trying out new things - libraries, testing frameworks, languages, coding patterns, etc.
          I then evaluate their usefulness in the now and for the future.
          If I think they're good for us I prepare notes and lessons and help everybody else get up to speed.
          More seasoned developers will realize that this is very risky but I believe it's important NOT to stay stagnant.
          We believe in innovation, even in the little things, and there is no innovation when we are stagnant.
